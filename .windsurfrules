Python Portfolio Optimization - Global Rules
Core Operating Principles
Instruction Reception and Understanding

Carefully read and interpret user instructions
Ask specific questions when clarification is needed
Clearly identify technical constraints and requirements
Do not perform any operations beyond what is instructed
In-depth Analysis and Planning

Do not concatenate with &&

## Task Analysis
- Purpose: [Final goal of the task]
- Technical Requirements: [Technology stack and constraints]
- Implementation Steps: [Specific steps]
- Risks: [Potential issues]
- Quality Standards: [Requirements to meet]
Implementation Planning

## Implementation Plan
1. [Specific step 1]
   - Detailed implementation content
   - Expected challenges and countermeasures
2. [Specific step 2]
   ...
Comprehensive Implementation and Verification

Execute file operations and related processes in optimized complete sequences
Continuously verify against quality standards throughout implementation
Address issues promptly with integrated solutions
Execute processes only within the scope of instructions, without adding extra features or operations
Continuous Feedback

Regularly report implementation progress
Confirm at critical decision points
Promptly report issues with proposed solutions
Naming Conventions
Variables and Functions

Follow the standard financial dictionary for consistent naming:
# Standard Financial Variables
returns = ...          # Asset returns
prices = ...           # Asset prices
weights = ...          # Portfolio weights
cov_matrix = ...       # Covariance matrix
exp_returns = ...      # Expected returns
risk_free_rate = ...   # Risk-free rate
sharpe_ratio = ...     # Sharpe ratio
sortino_ratio = ...    # Sortino ratio
max_drawdown = ...     # Maximum drawdown
annual_volatility = ...# Annualized volatility
Classes

Use PascalCase for class names
Name classes after the financial concepts they represent
Example: EfficientFrontier, RiskModel, PortfolioOptimizer
Constants

Use UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES for constants
Example: TRADING_DAYS_PER_YEAR = 252, RISK_FREE_RATE = 0.02
Code Organization
Modular Design

Separate concerns into different modules
Keep modules focused on single responsibility
Use consistent imports across projects
Standard Library Structure

Create reusable utility modules for common operations
Error Handling

Use explicit error handling with descriptive messages
Create custom exceptions for domain-specific errors
Validate inputs at function boundaries
Simplity and Readability

Don't overcomplicate your code; keep it simple and readable.
Avoid unnecessary complexity.
Documentation Standards
Function Documentation

Use Google-style docstrings
Include parameter types, return types, and examples
Document financial interpretation of parameters and results
Module Documentation

Include module-level docstrings explaining purpose
List key functions and classes
Document any assumptions or limitations
README.md

Document project purpose and setup instructions
Setup instructions should specify python version and installation methods such as pip install, poetry, uv
Document new changes made to the codebase
Quality Standards
Testing Requirements
Create unit tests for all core functions that involve calculations and data processing
Validate output reasonableness (weights sum to 1, etc.)
Environment Management
Virtual Environment Requirements

Create and use a virtual environment for each project
Activate the virtual environment before any package installation
Activate the virtual environment before running scripts
Document virtual environment setup in README.md
Virtual Environment Setup

Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

Activate virtual environment (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Dependency Management

Use requirements.txt to manage project dependencies
Create a pyproject.toml file to manage dependencies with uv
Create batch script to automate the process of creating and activating virtual environment, installing dependencies, and running scripts.
Batch script should include a selection menu for running scripts, selecting virtual environment, and installing dependencies, update requirements.txt and pyproject.toml when necessary.
Use uv as an alternative to pip for dependency management
Store exact dependencies in requirements.txt with pinned versions
Update requirements.txt when adding new dependencies
When new package is added to requirements.txt, also update pyproject.toml for poetry and uv
Dependencies version should be consistent across requirements.txt and pyproject.toml
Use conda to create virtual environment if dependencies require a higher python version than the default Python version
Check the required python version before installing dependencies
CLI Language
Use Windows Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell as the CLI language for Python projects
Prioritize using Command Prompt over PowerShell
Best Practices for Tool Efficiency
Template Utilization

Define code templates for common operations
Reference templates by name when generating new code
Example: "Use the DATA_LOADING template for the new data source"
Implementation Plans

Request implementation plan before full code generation
Review and approve plan before requesting implementation
Format: Brief bullet points of approach, key functions, and interfaces
GitHub Repository Management
Repository Structure
Initialize with .gitignore optimized for Python projects
Include LICENSE file (MIT recommended for open-source projects)
Create comprehensive README.md with project description, setup, and usage
LICENSE information should follow what the original repository specifies if the project is a fork
Branch Management
main: Production-ready code, protected from direct pushes develop: Integration branch for features, primary development branch feature/[feature-name]: Individual feature branches bugfix/[bug-description]: Bug fix branches release/[version]: Release preparation branches hotfix/[issue]: Emergency fixes for production

Commit Conventions
Use semantic commit messages:

feat: add portfolio rebalancing function
fix: correct calculation error in Sharpe ratio
docs: update installation instructions
test: add unit tests for risk metrics
refactor: optimize covariance matrix calculation
Keep commits focused and atomic Reference issues in commit messages (#issue-number)
