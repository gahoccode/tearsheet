Run `git diff $ARGUMENTS` to analyze all changes made in this branch. 

**Your task:**
1. Review the COMPLETE diff output to understand what was implemented
2. Create a TODO list of files/functions to investigate further if the diff doesn't show enough context
3. Execute those TODOs - read additional files as needed for full understanding
4. Determine if this is a significant architectural change (new service, caching layer, database integration, API changes, etc.)
5. If significant, create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) that documents:
   - The technical decisions made in the code
   - Why this approach was chosen (inferred from the implementation)
   - Trade-offs and alternatives (based on what you see in the code)

**Instructions:**
- Use the ADR template from this directory `./docs/architecture` if it exists
- Create the ADR in `docs/adr/` folder (create folders if needed)
- Update on the existing files in the directory, with currently created file Name it: `semantic-caching.md` (or other descriptive name based on the change)
- Focus on WHAT you see in the code, not hypotheticals
- Include specific technical details: libraries used, data structures, algorithms, actual values and approriately pick files to update based on the what you see in `./docs/architecture`
- Document actual configuration values and thresholds you find in the code
- **Prioritize accuracy**: Read as many files as needed to fully understand the change
- If you see references to functions/classes not in the diff, investigate them

**Skip ADR creation if:**
- Only minor bug fixes or refactoring
- Documentation or test-only changes
- Configuration tweaks without architectural impact

The ADR should help reviewers understand the architectural decisions without needing to dig through all the code changes.
