# ADR-001: Modular Architecture Adoption

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The original tearsheet application was implemented as a monolithic Flask application with all business logic, data access, and validation mixed together in a single `app.py` file. This approach led to several challenges:

- Code maintainability issues due to lack of separation of concerns
- Difficulty in unit testing individual components
- Challenges in scaling the application functionality
- Code duplication and inconsistent error handling
- Tight coupling between different application layers

As the application grew to include financial ratio analysis alongside portfolio analysis, the need for a more structured, modular architecture became apparent.

## Decision

We will adopt a layered, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Flask routes and templates (`app.py`, `templates/`)
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic and orchestration (`src/services/`)  
3. **Core Layer**: Domain logic and calculations (`src/core/`)
4. **Data Models**: Business entities and validation (`src/models/`)
5. **Utilities**: Cross-cutting concerns (`src/utils/`)
6. **Configuration**: Environment-specific settings (`config/`)

Key architectural patterns implemented:
- **Dependency Injection**: Services instantiated at application startup
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access through service interfaces
- **Domain Model Pattern**: Rich domain objects with validation
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear boundaries between application layers

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to understand and modify
- **Enhanced Testability**: Individual components can be unit tested in isolation with mocked dependencies
- **Better Code Reusability**: Services can be reused across different features (portfolio and ratio analysis)
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Centralized exception handling and validation
- **Scalability**: Easier to add new features without affecting existing functionality
- **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different layers simultaneously

### Negative Consequences

- **Increased Complexity**: More files and directories to manage
- **Initial Development Overhead**: Time investment required for refactoring
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand the new architecture patterns

### Risk Mitigation

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Architecture diagrams and component documentation
- **Progressive Migration**: Gradual refactoring rather than big-bang approach
- **Automated Testing**: Unit and integration tests to prevent regressions
- **Code Review Process**: Ensure adherence to architectural principles

## Implementation

### Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Completed)**: Create module structure and extract core services
- **Phase 2 (Completed)**: Implement validation and data services  
- **Phase 3 (Completed)**: Migrate business logic to appropriate layers
- **Phase 4 (Completed)**: Update tests to match new structure
- **Phase 5 (Completed)**: Documentation and architecture diagrams

### Resources Required

- Senior developer time for architectural design and implementation
- Team training on new architectural patterns
- Documentation updates and creation

### Dependencies

- Python package structure reorganization
- Import statement updates throughout codebase
- Test suite modifications

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Keep Monolithic Structure**: Continue with single-file approach
   - **Rejected**: Would not address scalability and maintainability concerns

2. **Microservices Architecture**: Split into separate services for portfolio and ratios
   - **Rejected**: Overkill for current scale; would introduce deployment complexity

3. **MVC Pattern**: Traditional Model-View-Controller separation
   - **Rejected**: Less suitable for data processing applications; layered architecture better fits analytical workflows

4. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ports and adapters pattern
   - **Considered**: Too complex for current requirements; could be future evolution
